K4PCDeDRM - K4PCDeDRM_X.XX_plugin.zip
Requires Calibre version 0.6.44 or higher.

This work is based on the work of cmbtc, skindle, mobidedrm. and skindleAll I had the much easier job of converting them to a Calibre plugin.

This plugin is meant to Kindle for PC azw ebooks that are protected
with Amazon's Mobi based encryption. It is meant to function without having to install any dependencies... other than having both Calibre installed and Kindle for PC on the same machine, of course. 

Installation:

Go to Calibre's Preferences page... click on the Plugins button. Use the file dialog button to select the plugin's zip file  (K4PCDeDRM_X.XX_plugin.zip) and click the 'Add' button. you're done.
