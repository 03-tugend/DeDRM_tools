Rev1_1

fixed program to allow any file extension.  My testing indicates that 
skindle does not care what file extension a file has.  If it is a file type
that it can convert it will.  If the file is not compatible it will close
and give an unknown file type message.

Rev1_0

If the program is run with no files in the input directory you will get a 
“File not Found” error and the program will terminate.

PLEASE USE ONLY FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE – ON BOOKS YOU PAID FOR!!

This program is provided to allow you to archive your library in a format that 
will outlast the kindle.  Technology moves on and you should not have to reinvest 
in an entire new library when the Kindle is obsolete.  Please do not use this program 
for piracy.
