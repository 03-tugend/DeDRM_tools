README

unswindle can be used to find the book specific PID but it needs to be updated for each version of Kindle4PC that Amazon releases (and therefore is also useful for Linux users who have Wine). This program “patches” the Kindle4PC executable and therefore is very release specific.

Unfortunately unswindle v7 the latest, has not been updated to work with the latest version of Kindle for PC.  You will need to find one of the older versions of Kindle4PC and prevent later updates in order to use this tool.
