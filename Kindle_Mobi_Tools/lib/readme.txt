These scripts allow one to read legally purchased Secure Mobipocket books
on Amazon Kindle or Kindle for iPhone.

* kindlepid.py
  This script generates Mobipocket PID from the Kindle serial number or iPhone/iPod Touch
  identifier (UDID). That PID can then be added at a Mobi retailer site and used for downloading 
  books locked to the Kindle.
  
  Example: 
    
    > kindlepid.py B001BAB012345678

* kindlefix.py
  This script adds a "CustomDRM" flag necessary for opening Secure
  Mobipocket books on Kindle. The book has to be enabled for Kindle's PID
  (generated by kindlepid.py). The "fixed" book is written with  
  extension ".azw". That file can then be uploaded to Kindle for reading.

    > kindlefix.py MyBook.mobi V176CXM*FZ
