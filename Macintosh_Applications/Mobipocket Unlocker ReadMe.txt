Mobipocket Unlocker

How to get Drag&Drop decryption of DRM-encumbered Mobipocket eBook files.

You'll need the MobiDeDRM.py python script, as well as an installed version 2.4 or later of python. If you have Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) you already have a suitable version of python installed as part of Leopard.

Control-click the script and select "Show Package Contents" from the contextual menu. Copy the python script, which must be called "MobiDeDRM.py" into the Resources folder inside the Contents folder. (NB not into the Scripts folder - that's where the Applescript part is stored.)

Close the package, and you now have a drag&drop Mobipocket unlocker.

You can use the AppleScript ScriptEditor application to put your Mobipocket code into the script to save you having to enter it in the dialog all the time.
