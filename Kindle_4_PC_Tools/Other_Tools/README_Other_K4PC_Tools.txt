- LZskindle4PC is a front end for running skindle that makes it easier for some people who do not like command lines to use it.

- skindle has completely reverse engineered how the book specific PID is generated for Kindle4PC so it can be very useful when new version of Kindle4PC are released and unswindle has not yet been updated.  Unfortunately, skindle has some minor bugs that can actually result in corrupted eBooks.  No one has yet tracked them down and fixed them.  Until they do, use at your own risk.

- unswindle can be used to find the book specific PID but it needs to be updated for each version of Kindle4PC that Amazon releases (and therefore is also useful for Linux users who have Wine). This program “patches” the Kindle4PC executable and therefore is very release specific.
Unfortunately unswindle v7 the latest, has not been updated to work with the latest version of Kindle for PC.  You will need to find one of the older versions of Kindle4PC and prevent later updates in order to use this tool.
